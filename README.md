# jQuery: Examples for Beginners

Introducing jQuery to beginners can be less intimidating if we focus on some of the things that jQuery can do with only a tiny amount of code. “Write less. Do more.” &mdash; that’s the jQuery motto.

jQuery effects are the first fun thing to learn. Try the buttons here to see these three effects: hide, slide, fade.

Based on module 2, “Learn jQuery: Effects,” in the Codecademy course [Introduction to jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/).

jQuery can be used to make things happen as a result of mouse actions, including movement and mouse button clicks. On the previous page, all the jQuery events were click events. On this page, they are all mouse events.

There are three different examples of mouse events here:

* mouseenter/mouseleave &mdash; things can hide, fade, etc., because you moused over them, or something near them
* mouseup/mousedown &mdash; holding the mouse button down, then letting it go, can trigger two different results
* mousemove &mdash; tracking the movements of the mouse provides X-Y coordinates that we can use to move things on the page

The last one is a bit complicated, but the first two are simple.

There are Codepen links on both of the above pages.
